WARNING flwr 2024-03-28 00:17:04,282 | logger.py:118 |
        DEPRECATED FEATURE: flwr.client.start_numpy_client() is deprecated.
	Instead, use `flwr.client.start_client()` by ensuring you first call the `.to_client()` method as shown below:
	flwr.client.start_client(
		server_address='<IP>:<PORT>',
		client=FlowerClient().to_client(), # <-- where FlowerClient is of type flwr.client.NumPyClient object
	)
	Using `start_numpy_client()` is deprecated.
        This is a deprecated feature. It will be removed
        entirely in future versions of Flower.
